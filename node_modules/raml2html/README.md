A simple RAML to HTML documentation generator, written for Node.js, with theme support.

### RAML version support
raml2html 4 and higher only support RAML 1.0 files. Please stick with raml2html 3.x for RAML 0.8 support.


## Install
```
npm i -g raml2html
```


## Themes
raml2html ships with a default theme, but you can install more from NPM. For example, to render
RAML to Markdown, you can install the raml2html-markdown-theme theme:

```
npm i -g raml2html-markdown-theme
```

Search NPM for the "raml2html-theme" keyword (or use [this link](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/raml2html-theme))
to find more themes.

## Usage

### As a command line script
```
raml2html --help
raml2html example.raml > example.html
raml2html --theme raml2html-markdown-theme example.raml > example.html
raml2html --template my-custom-template.nunjucks -i example.raml -o example.html
```

### As a library

#### Using the default theme, different themes, or your own Nunjucks templates
```javascript
const raml2html = require('raml2html');
const configWithDefaultTheme = raml2html.getConfigForTheme();
const configForDifferentTheme = raml2html.getConfigForTheme('raml2html-markdown-theme');
const configWithCustomTemplate = raml2html.getConfigForTemplate('my-custom-template.nunjucks', __dirname);

// source can either be a filename, url, or parsed RAML object
raml2html.render(source, configWithDefaultTheme).then(function(result) {
  // Save the result to a file or do something else with the result
}, function(error) {
  // Output error
});
```

#### Using your own processing function, for full control over the whole rendering process
```javascript
/**
 * config should be an object with at least an `processRamlObj` property which is a function that receives the raw RAML
 * object and must return a promise with the result. You can do whatever you want in this function.
 *
 * You can also supply a postProcessHtml function that can for example minify the generated HTML.
 */
raml2html.render(source, config).then(function(result) {
  // Save the result to a file or do something else with the result
}, function(error) {
  // Output error
});
```

If you only want to configure the default Nunjucks environment you don't have to override the entire `processRamlObj`
function. Just get the default config (`const config = raml2html.getDefaultConfig();`) and add a `setupNunjucks` function
to it that takes `env` as its only parameter.

See also `example/script.js` for an example of using raml2html as a library.

### Gulp
You can use the [raml2html directly from Gulp](https://gist.github.com/iki/784ddd5ab33c1e1b726b).

## Before you report a bug
If you get parsing errors, please do not report them to raml2html: it doesn't do the actual RAML parsing.
Review the error and fix your RAML file, or open a new issue at [raml-js-parser](https://github.com/raml-org/raml-js-parser-2).
